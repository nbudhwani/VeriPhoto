## Setup and Usage
1. Open chrome://extensions and click Load Unpacked, clicking on the root folder of the extension.
2. Browse to tabs. To see the debug messages, open up the developer console on web pages (e.g. Kaggle) that show real and fake deepfake images.

## To Do
We are welcoming your participation and pull requests! The first thing we would love the deepfake detection enthusiasist community's (THAT'S YOU!) input on is decreasing the load on the browser (see logs in Chrome DevTools).
